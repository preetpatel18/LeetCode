# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems, complete with explanations and code. I’m using this repository to improve my algorithm skills, document my learning, and track my progress.

## About This Repository
This repository is dedicated to solving problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), an online platform for practicing algorithms and data structures. Here, I document my thought process, code, and different approaches to various problems. It serves as both a personal reference and a way to share solutions with others in the coding community.

## Structure
Each problem is organized into a folder named based on their level of dificulty. Inside each folder, you will find:
- **Solutions** (Each file name doesn't include spaces so when trying to find a file for a specific problem. Please refer to a file name with same title and no spaces)

## Languages and Tools
- **Languages**: Mainly using Java for problem-solving, but occasionally Python and JavaScript.
- **IDE**: Visual Studio/VS-Code Code for all the languages.
- **Version Control**: Git is used to manage and track changes in the code.
- **LeetCode Profile**: You can view my [LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.com/u/MrxNoobie/) for a summary of solved problems and achievements.

## Solution Approach
I approach each problem by following these steps:
1. **Understand the Problem**: Carefully read the problem statement and constraints to identify the expected inputs and outputs.
2. **Plan the Solution**: I sketch out possible solutions, taking note of edge cases and time-space complexities.
3. **Implement the Code**: I start coding, often iterating as I discover improvements or issues with the initial solution.
4. **Test and Optimize**: I test the solution with various test cases and optimize it where possible for efficiency.

## Progress Tracking
I keep a log of solved problems, including:
- The problem’s difficulty level.
- The date I solved it.
- Notes on the approach I used.

This helps me monitor my progress and identify areas for improvement.
